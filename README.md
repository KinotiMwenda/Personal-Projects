This repository will contain a portfolio of Data Analysis projects I do in my free time to satisfy my curiosity.
The topics of interest ranging from astronomy, economics, social sciences, and meteorology, to so much more.
It will involve AI, machine learning, statistical methods, and mathematical modeling.
